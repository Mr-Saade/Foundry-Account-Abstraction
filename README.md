# Account Abstraction with Foundry

<br/>

This repository contains two Account Abstraction projects built using Foundry:

- One compatible with Ethereum (Arbitrum as an example of EVM chains)
- One compatible with zkSync (Layer 2 solution)

## What is Account Abstraction?

Account Abstraction (AA) refers to allowing users to interact with blockchains using smart contracts as their account rather than traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) that rely on private keys.

To put it simply, **Account Abstraction** turns EOAs into smart contracts with customizable logic for transaction validation and authorization.

> Account abstraction means that not only the execution of a transaction can involve complex computation logic, but also the authorization logic can be customized.
> â€“ _Vitalik Buterin_

## What does this project showcase?

1. A minimal EVM-compatible "Smart Wallet" using alt-mempool-based Account Abstraction on Ethereum (Arbitrum in this case).
2. A minimal zkSync "Smart Wallet" using native Account Abstraction.
   - [zkSync AA is slightly different from ERC-4337](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/account-abstraction.html#iaccount-interface).

## What does this project not cover?

1. Sending user operations to the alt-mempool.
